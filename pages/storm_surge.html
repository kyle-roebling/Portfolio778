        <h3>Technologies Used: Leaflet | Flask | PostGIS</h3></br>
        <p>The Coastal Alabama Storm Surge Application is an informational tool that shows potential impacts of storm surge across Alabama Coastal counties of Mobile and Baldwin counties. These two counties are no strangers to hurricane activity. Seeing direct hits from Hurricane Sally in September 2020 and Major Hurricane Ivan in September 2004. When most people think of hurricanes, the first image that that comes to mind is winds. While winds do create a substantial amount of damage to structures, they only account for 8% of deaths in tropical systems. Storm surge on the other hand accounts for 49% of all tropical cyclone deaths (Erdman, 2019). Almost all these deaths are preventable due to increases in weather modeling technology that can predict accurate storm surge projections for an area. There are many reasons people do not heed evacuation orders. Some are concerned with property theft after an event. Some site previous storms that did not pan out as predicted. Many simply do not fully realize the threat that storm surge can cause to life and property. This application sets out to inform the user on the potential impacts of storm surge in a visual format. Most people act once they see something rather than just hearing about.</p>
        <p>The genesis of the idea for the Alabama Coastal Storm Surge application began with a final project that was completed in my first GIS course at the University of South Alabama. That project looked at the potential impacts of storm surge of a category 5 hurricane hitting Mobile, AL. The analysis for the project was done manually using ArcMap and Excel to show how many people, buildings, and roads would be potentially impacted. The problem with that project was how to replicate that workflow to do analysis within another city in the Mobile and Baldwin County area. The Alabama Coast Storm Surge is the solution to that problem and allows even a non-GIS user to replicate that same process that was performed manually using ArcMap and Excel. </p>
