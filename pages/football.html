          College football Saturdays, there is nothing quite like the energy on campus knowing your rival school is the opponent that day or playing for a chance to be one of the four teams selected for the college football playoffs. College football is the lifeblood of many universities providing most of the funds to support other athletic programs at the university. Fans and boosters expect to see a winning team, or the crowds begin to fade, and the donor money becomes less and less each year. The glory of a conference or national championship is won many years before on the road visiting and recruiting the best high school players across the country. The programs that can bring in top recruits routinely end up at the top of the college football world.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project I will be looking at the geographical component in college football recruiting for 10 major football programs representing each of the major regions and conferences. The schools selected for this project are the Wisconsin Badgers, Florida Gators, Alabama Crimson Tide, Notre Dame Fighting Irish, USC Trojans, Clemson Tigers, Texas Longhorns, Ohio St Buckeyes Oklahoma Sooners, and Oregon Ducks. This project will be built using a web map that allows users to query out by team, conference, player rating, and position to look at the spatial location of the best players across the country. The front end of the web map will be designed in html, CSS and JavaScript using bootstrap and leaflet technologies. The data will be hosted in a PostgreSQL database with java servlet handling the http request and response between the client and server. The data for this project will be collected from 247 sports college football recruiting rankings.
